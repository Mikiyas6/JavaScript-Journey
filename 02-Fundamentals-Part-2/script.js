"use strict";
// Helps us to avoid accidental errors being introduced in our code
// It does this by
// Not allowing us to do certain things and
// It will actually create visible errors in certain situations
// in which without strict mode JS would fail silently
// without letting us know that we did a mistake
//Example: Helps us to catch syntax errors like missing letters
// let hasDriversLicense = false;
// let passTest = true;

// hasDriverLicense = passTest ? true : false;
// hasDriversLicense ? console.log("I can drive!") : console.log("");
