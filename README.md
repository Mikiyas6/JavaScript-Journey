# My JavaScript Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my **JavaScript Journey**! This repository is a collection of all the projects, exercises, and learnings I've gained throughout my exploration of JavaScript, from beginner concepts to advanced features.

## Overview üìö

This repo serves as a timeline of my progress, starting from the basics of JavaScript to more complex topics such as **asynchronous programming**, **JavaScript frameworks**, and **design patterns**. Each folder contains specific projects or exercises that helped me solidify my understanding.

### Key Milestones:

1. **Fundamentals**: 
   - Variables, functions, control structures
   - DOM Manipulation
   - Basic Algorithms

2. **Intermediate**:
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Promises and Async/Await
   - JavaScript modules (ES6+)

3. **Advanced**:
   - Functional Programming
   - Design Patterns (MVC, Singleton, etc.)
   - Tooling (Webpack, Babel)

## Why I Created This Repo ü§î

I believe that the best way to learn programming is by doing, which is why I‚Äôm documenting my journey here. By keeping track of all the things I learn, I can review and reflect on my growth over time.

## What's Next? üåü
I‚Äôm continuously updating this repository as I move forward in my JavaScript journey. Next, I plan to focus on:

  - Mastering JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue
      - Check out My React Journey Repo [Github-link](https://github.com/Mikiyas6/REACT-Journey)
  - Deepening my understanding of Node.js and backend development
  - Working on full-stack JavaScript projects
